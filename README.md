# TibialModulationSim
A python based simulation of the bladder control circuit and the effects of tibial neuromodulation.

# Network Topology
The topology of the network is based upon [previous work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23033877/). Neurons are simulated using a "Conductancce-Based Adaptive Exponential Linear-Integrate-and-Fire" model [(CAdEx)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33253029/)". Synaptic connections are programmed to dynamically alter their weights according to relative spike timing.
